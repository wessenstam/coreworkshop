Getting Started
---------------

Welcome to the Nutanix Core Workshop! This workshop may accompany an instructor-led session that introduces Nutanix Core technologies and many common management tasks.

You will explore Prism Element and become familiar with its features and navigation. You will use Prism to perform basic cluster administration tasks, including storage and networking. You will also walk through basic VM deployment and management tasks with Prism and AHV. Finally, you will explore VM data protection, including snapshots and replication. The instructor explains the exercises and answers any additional questions that you may have.

At the end of the bootcamp, attendees should understand the Core concepts and technologies that make up the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud stack.

Environment Details
+++++++++++++++++++

Nutanix Workshops are intended to be run in the Nutanix Hosted POC environment. Your cluster will be provisioned with all necessary images, networks, and VMs required to complete the exercises.

Networking
..........

Hosted POC clusters follow a standard naming convention:

- **Cluster Name** - POC\ *XYZ*
- **Subnet** - 10.**21**.\ *XYZ*\ .0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.**21**.\ *XYZ*\ .37

If provisioned from the marketing pool:

- **Cluster Name** - MKT\ *XYZ*
- **Subnet** - 10.**20**.\ *XYZ*\ .0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.**20**.\ *XYZ*\ .37

For example:

- **Cluster Name** - POC055
- **Subnet** - 10.21.55.0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.21.55.37

Throughout the Workshop there are multiple instances where you will need to substitute *XYZ* with the correct octet for your subnet, for example:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - IP Address
     - Description
   * - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .37
     - Nutanix Cluster Virtual IP
   * - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .39
     - **PC** VM IP, Prism Central
   * - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .40
     - **DC** VM IP, NTNXLAB.local Domain Controller

Each cluster is configured with 2 VLANs which can be used for VMs:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 25 25 10 40
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Network Name
    - Address
    - VLAN
    - DHCP Scope
  * - Primary
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .1/25
    - 0
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .50-10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .124
  * - Secondary
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .129/25
    - *XYZ1*
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .132-10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .253

Credentials
...........

.. note::

  The *<Cluster Password>* is unique to each cluster and will be provided by the leader of the Workshop.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 35 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Credential
     - Username
     - Password
   * - Prism Element

Each cluster has a dedicated domain controller VM, **DC**, responsible for providing AD services for the **NTNXLAB.local** domain. The domain is populated with the following Users and Groups:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 35 40
